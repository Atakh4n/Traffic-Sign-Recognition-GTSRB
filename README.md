# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-GTSRB - # Traffic Sign Recognition Project

## Summary

This project aims to enhance traffic safety by developing an artificial intelligence model capable of accurately recognizing traffic signs in real-world scenarios. Leveraging the TensorFlow library and the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset, the model is trained to achieve high accuracy rates.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- GTSRB dataset

## Installation

1. Clone the project: https://github.com/Atakh4n/Traffic-Sign-Recognition-GTSRB.git

2. Install the required libraries: tensorflow,random,numpy,matplotlib.pyplot,pandas,cv2,keras

3. Download the GTSRB dataset and place it into the main directory of the project.(It is already in the project /myData)

## Usage

1. To train the model, run the `train.py` file (Already trained)
